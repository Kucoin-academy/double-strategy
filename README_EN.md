## Strategy description

Among most of the trading strategies, there is a well-known as 'never lose money' trading strategy-Martingale strategy.  

### Martingale strategy

Originally, martingale referred to a class of betting strategies that was popular in 18th-century France. It is still popular in the casino system, called "never lose mony" Maringale, it is still limited the times of adding to positions.

**The rule of Martingale strategy: The gambler double their bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake**.  

Since Martingale's strategy was applied to financial trading market, it is creating many profit miracles and Waterloo-style losses.  

**The principle of this strategy: The market will always call back, which means each trade profit or loss is a random independent event**  

It may be correct for a long term period, but the truth in market is always more complicated, **as the price is neither random, nor traders have unlimited chips**.   

**Therefore, the Martingale strategy may perform good in shock market. Once breaking shock market, traders would face a very big risk**.

## Anti-martingale strategy

The rule of Anti-martingale is to operate the Martingale strategy in reverse: **The gambler double their bet after every win until approaching the wins in hope, then restart from one bet. If losing before the wins in hope, then restart from one bet, too.**

This is the variation of Maringale in market. In general, it obtains high profits by gradually increasing positions in the early stages of the trend after the traders judged that the market has entered a unilateral trend through some indicators, and controlling the number of times to control the risk.

Martingale strategy is a useful postion strategy, but both of gain and lose are from chaos: its fundamental flaw is that the market is defaulted to a single-state random probability, so it's better to careful use it with trend indicators.
